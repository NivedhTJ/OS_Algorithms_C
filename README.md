OS_Algorithms_C
A collection of CPU scheduling, disk scheduling, and page replacement algorithm implementations in C, simulating core concepts of Operating Systems.

#Overview

This repository contains C implementations of fundamental operating system algorithms, including:

CPU Scheduling Algorithms: Simulate how processes are scheduled for execution.

Disk Scheduling Algorithms: Manage how disk I/O requests are ordered.

Page Replacement Algorithms: Handle memory management by deciding which memory pages to swap out.

These implementations serve as educational tools for understanding the inner workings of operating systems.

Contents
The repository is organized into the following directories:

CPU_Scheduling_Algorithms/: Contains implementations of various CPU scheduling algorithms.

Disk_Scheduling_Algorithms/: Includes different disk scheduling algorithm simulations.

Page_reaplacement_Algorithms/: Houses page replacement algorithm implementations.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To compile and run the programs, ensure you have a C compiler installed, such as gcc.
